    <article style="background-color: #808080; padding: 20px;">
      Recently, there's been an outbreak of talking chipmunks. In southern California, 14-year old Jamal Skibidi was walking home from school, where he encountered a herd of chipmunks communicating with each other. Jamal was astonished. He was eavesdropping in and heard them plotting to take over the human race. He immediately ran to the nearest police station to report what he heard. Apparently, this isn't the first case of this. People from cities like Cairo, Milan and Sydney have also been saying the same thing. IS THE HUMAN RACE REALLY IN DANGER?!?!

    <h3 style="padding: 12px;">THE ROCK FINDS HIS GROOVE??</h3>
    <article style="background-color: #808080; padding: 20px;">
      Dwayne Johnson, better known as "The Rock", has been secretly dancing to some of Adele's latest hits. A video recording from last Sunday shows this to be evident. In the video, The Rock is shown to be dressed up as Maui from Moana and in the video he is with his 2 daughters and they're all singing and dancing to some of Adele's music. This lovely interaction shows Dwayne's innocent nature and we all should strive to be like him.
